The main Minecraft server has been updated to 1.21.4, following this morning's daily restart.

Whilst there were some issues earlier with the resource pack, these have now been resolved.

Players who have created custom NMTs which need to be updated can use the #New Model Technology Discussion Tab forum post should they have any queries as to updating their resource pack to be compatible with 1.21.4.
