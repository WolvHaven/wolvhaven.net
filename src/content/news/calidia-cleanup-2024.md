**Update (15/05/2024)** <br>
Hello everyone, it has been three months since the clean up was announced. From today, all claims which still have the ‚ö†Ô∏è icon remaining will be moved to the red flag üö© category. This means that the claim has been deemed abandoned and is liable to being removed or is up for adoption. Please open a `‚Å†#helpop` ticket if you are interested in adopting one of these claims. An updated list of claims up for adoption will be posted below and in `‚Å†#Calidia Spring 2024 Cleanup`.

Thank you to all who have reached out to indicate that they wished to relinquish or keep their claims.

Hello everyone, as some of you may have spotted, the dynmap has some new icons in Calidia. This is part of the upcoming Calidia cleanup.

## Why a cleanup?

Calidia has now become the main city building world with most activity taking place there over Gardellia and there has been feedback regarding a perceived crowdedness of the world as of late. Whilst a world expansion is still on the cards, server leadership and CARD have decided to undertake an audit of existing claims.

## A bit of background

This is similar to what was done on a regular basis in Gardellia prior to December 2020. The monthly abandoned claims check was suspended following that due to the opening of Calidia and resulting additional space, along with decreased activity on the server following new post-Covid player activity trends from 2022 onwards.

## What does this mean for me?

Please check the [dynmap](http://play.wolvhaven.net:8123/?worldname=Calidia) to see if your claim is affected by the cleanup or see if your claim and username is listed below.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è icon indicates that you must notify `@CARD` on Discord (via a ‚Å†helpop ticket) if you wish to retain your claim.
- üö© icon indicates that the claim has been deemed abandoned and is liable to being removed or is up for adoption. Once again please open a ‚Å†helpop ticket to indicate whether you are interested in adoption.

## Why is my claim included?

Criteria such as player inactivity, claim development, date of claiming have all been considered when conducting the audit.
