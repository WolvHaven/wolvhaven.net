## What is the Referendum on the Mode of Representation?
As announced earlier on October 14 2020, [key changes are coming to the WolvHaven Political System](/news/2020-10-14-political-system-changes). The biggest change is that members of staff will no longer be allowed to run or take part in any election, and the redefinition of the House of Representatives & the Senate’s roles as houses to represent the community, and staff management interests respectively.

With that, a referendum on the mode of representation was also announced, and after consultation with the community, the questions and options have been finalized, and will be put to a vote on the 27 to 29 November 2020.

## What are the questions?
| 1. Do you support direct-elect ministerial positions(DEP)? | 2. Under DEP, do you want general Members of Parliament? | 3. If there are General MPs, how should they be elected? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

<br/>

### Question 1: Do you support direct-elect ministerial positions (DEP)?

| YES | NO |
| ----- | ----- |
| **I support having direct elections for ministerial positions.** | **I do not support having direct elections for ministerial positions.** |

<br/>

**YES - I support having direct elections for ministerial positions.**

Interested candidates will run for any of the following portfolios:
- Minister for Internal Affairs
- Minister for Gardellian Affairs
- Minister for Community & Social Development, and Foreign Affairs
- Minister for Infrastructure and National Development

Eligible voters will have 4 seperate votes for each position, and candidates will be elected under the Alternative Voting system

Voters will rank candidates in order of preference, and the least popular candidate is eliminated, with their votes transferred to their next indicated preference until any candidate gets 50%, or is the last one standing.

**NO - I do not support having direct elections for ministerial positions.**

Under this option, WolvHaven will continue to stick to the existing Party-List Proportionate Representation system

Players will continue to elect a party they want to represent them.

However, under this system, there will be no independents

### Question 2: Under a direct-elect ministerial position system, do you want general Members of Parliament (MPs)?

| YES | NO |
| ----- | ----- |
| **I want to have general members of parliament.** | **I do not want general members of parliament.** |

<br/>

**YES - I want to have general members of parliament.**
- Electors will get another vote for candidates they want to take on the role of Members of Parliament.
- Members will be elected under the system chosen in the third question.

**NO - I do not want general members of parliament.**
- Electors will only get 4 separate votes for each ministerial position.
- General MPs will cease to exist.

### Question 3: If there are general Members of Parliament, how should they be elected?

| YES | NO |
| ----- | ----- |
| **STV - I want MPs elected via the Single Transferrable Vote.** | **PLP - I want MPs elected on a Party-List Proportionate system.** |

<br/>

**STV - I want MPs elected via the Single Transferrable Vote.**
- Electors will rank candidates in order of preference
- Not everyone has to be ranked, you may leave out people you do not support
- Candidates who receive enough votes to hit a threshold get a seat
- Excess votes are proportionately transferred
- The least-popular candidate is eliminated, their votes transferred to their next preference

**PLP - I want MPs elected on a Party-List Proportionate system.**
- Electors will vote for a party they support
- Similar to the current system being used
- Seats a party wins is proportionate to the % of votes received for their party
- No independents
