## Happy New Year 🎉 2️⃣ 0️⃣ 2️⃣ 6️⃣

Wishing you all a Happy New Year! To kick off the new year, thanks to support from jotch and others, we're excited to announce ~~that we're excited~~ that the Metro in 5H has been upgraded.

Keep a look out for the new Class WH9 inspired from the Paris Metro MP89 now running alongside our existing Class WH17s on all lines.

The trains have also been fixed!
You should not need the smoothcoasters mod anymore to look at and board the trains;
Trains are now also less resource intensive to use, so be sure to switch on that server resource pack!

Thank you for your patience while we sorted out and rolled out the upgrades. See ya'll around!
