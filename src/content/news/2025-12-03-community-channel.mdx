## New Community Youtube Channel

Hi WolvHaven,

Following feedback and discussion at previous Town Halls, we have launched a Community YouTube channel for members of our community who would prefer not to upload content on their own personal channels. WolvHaveners are encouraged to create content to share with us in ⁠```#community-media``` for us to then upload. I would like to emphasis that there will not be a high bar for editing quality, etc... as we wish for this new channel to be easily accessible for everyone to be able to contribute without feeling intimidated by a perceived high editing standard.

To kick off the channel, we have successfully coerced **SilverWolv**, a member of the server, to upload a timelapse of 5H Metro Line T3.5 which he had originally filmed for his personal Instagram account.

You can subscribe to the new channel at the link below...

As they say, 'please like and subscribe!'
