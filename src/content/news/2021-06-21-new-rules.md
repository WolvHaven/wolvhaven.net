Hello! As mentioned earlier in a previous post about the [upcoming changes to the WolvHaven experience](/news/2021-06-14-changes-server-experience), we mentioned that we would be simplifying and relaxing the rules and regulations.

If all goes according to plan, the new rules will come into force from the 1st July 2021, which is under 2 weeks away.
