## New PR Rank has been introduced

WolvHaveners voted in favor for the implementation of a new interim rank between the Visitor and Citizen ranks – called “Permanent Resident” (PR) in the January 2020 General Election/Referendum Exercise.

On 16 January 2020, the PR rank was introduced by executive order, mandating that new Visitors who have completed the Immigration Test be promoted to PR instead of Citizen, without any promotions from PR to Citizen until further notice.

## Applications Open from 13 March 2020.

The new Citizenship application will open from 13 March 2020. Links to the application forms can now be found in the Ranks/Application Forms pages under the information section of the WolvHaven website.

Applications will be processed on a weekly basis, with results released every Saturday/Sunday.
