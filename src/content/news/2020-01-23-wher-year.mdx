The WolvHavener of the year award celebrates the achievements and contributions by recognizing citizens who are leading role-models for all. Their achievements serve as an inspiration and challenge us to make our own contributions towards creating a better WolvHaven.

Honoring a group of well-respected citizens who spark discussions, change, and action on issues of national interest, the award also aims to promote active citizenry through the recognition of WolvHaveners who have contributed significantly to the community.

## The Awards

As of January 2020, there are currently two categories. This is subject to change based on community participation & nominations received.
- WolvHavener of the year
- WolvHaven Staff of the year

**Why are staff and citizens broken down into two categories?**

WolvHaven’s staff perform many duties that are required of them. Although their contributions as part of regular staff duties are not considered, they may be able to make certain contributions that Citizens would not have been able to make due to their rank.

As a result, to ensure the awards remain fair, it is split into two categories.

## Nomination Requirements & Selection criteria
- Ranked between Citizen and Admin
- Not self-nominated
- Number of nominations a person has received is not given any consideration
