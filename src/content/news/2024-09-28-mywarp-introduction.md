Hi WolvHaveners! The long awaited MyWarp plugin has just been implemented! This means players can create their own warps for use on warp signs on the server's creative worlds.

## How does it work?

Full documentation is available on the <a href="https://github.com/MyWarp/MyWarp/wiki" target="_blank">plugin's GitHub</a>, but here is the main gist of things.

### 1. Create a warp
```/mywarp create [warp name]``` This is your **destination warp**. Aka, where the warp sign will teleport players to.

There is no mandatory warp naming scheme but I'd advise you to keep things neat and organised. For instance, `World-Company-Location`. Here's an example: ```/mywarp create CA-PB-X10_Perfectshire```.

Note that players **[PR]** and above can only create warps in **Calidia** and **Gardellia** whilst those who hold the **[Builder]**, **[Architect]** or **[Engineer]** ranks can create warps in **FifthHaven**.

### 2. Create a warp sign
Now it's time to place your warp sign where places can warp from to the destination you just created. Place a sign with the following format: <br>
*line 1:* ```blank``` <br>
*line 2:* ```[MyWarp]``` <br>
*Line 3:* ```Warp Name``` <br>
*line 4:* ```blank```

And that's it! Just right click the sign to use the warp.

## Useful commands
```/mywarp delete [warp name]``` or ```/mywarp remove [warp name]``` - Deletes the warp. <br>
```/mywarp update [warp name]``` - Updates the warp location to the player's current position. <br>
```/mywarp welcome [warp name]``` - Changes the welcome message of the warp. <br>
```/mywarp assets``` - Lists your warps.
