## Upgrade to 1.13 Scheduled

As final testing on 1.13 has shown to be going well, with minor or no major expected disruption to the server experience, we are excited to announce that we are excited that we will be upgrading to 1.13.2 soon.

As of now, the tentative date for this upgrade is expected to be on **5 May 2020, from 3AM UTC**.

Judging from our test server upgrade, this downtime is expected to last between 4 to 6 hours, with the server hopefully ready by 9AM UTC.

## A final call to report bugs from the test server

We do not want to require a backup restore should there be any extreme bugs. Should a backup restore be required, all progress made on the server after the upgrade will be lost.

## Feasibility status for upgrade

**Sustainable** - This means that the server can operate as it is, taking into consideration several minor bugs and/or issues that only affect minute aspects of gameplay. 

## The following issues can be expected after the upgrade

- Lifts using EElevators having weird sign placements within lift cabins
- Lifts using ElevatorsV2 having weird glass pane door glitching, and iron doors being destroyed
