Hello WolvHaveners,

Some of you may have already noticed, but we are excited to announce ~~that we are excited~~ that we have relaunched our social media accounts with brand new content!

We're now on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wolvhaven.net) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@play.wolvhaven.net) in addition to our existing accounts on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WolvHaven), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WolvHaven) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wolvhaven/). We'd also welcome more activity on our existing very own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WolvHaven/). Following a thorough analysis of the changes to Twitter's algorithm, we have decided to no longer use the platform as remaining active on the it would not be to our benefit.

We'd also like to extend a warm welcome to **_somtingwong** to the public service team, who has been instrumental in helping us relaunch our socials. Here's a flavour of some of our new content.

Until next time,
