## Appeal Process

Please be mindful of the following when submitting your appeal:
- **Be respectful** - Avoid the use of insults, name-calling and ensure that your language is not in a demeaning/demanding tone.
- **Report the truth** - Providing false information can result in further penalties being placed against you.
- **Do not beg/demand** - Do not plead or demand action be taken.
- **Use English** - We can only understand English in most circumstances. Appeals made with other languages may take longer to process.

## Tips for Successful Appeal

Follow these tips for a higher chance of acceptance of your appeal:
- **Show understanding** - Players who show understanding and acknowledge that they have made a mistake have a higher chance of appeal being accepted. If unsure, of the reason, feel free to ask a member of staff.
- **Your track record matters** - Committing the same offense multiple times within a short period of time will result in a lower chance of acceptance. You are advised to take a month or two to reflect, then appeal again.
- **Appeal when appropriate** - 24 hours from the time of issue for all penalties, except unappealable permanent bans where the earliest appeal should be considered 6 months from the time of issue.
- **Hostile Behavior won’t get you anywhere** - (e.g. threatening to hack etc. consistently prior to appealing)
- **Sincerity matters** - Be sincere in your appeal, don’t do it “for the sake of doing it”. We can tell from the way you write your appeal.
- **Accept and move on** - If your appeal is rejected, appeal again after a month or stipulated time period
