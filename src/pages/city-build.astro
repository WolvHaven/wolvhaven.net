        <h2>Gardellia or Calidia?</h2>
        <h3>Gardellia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opened in 2016, Gardellia is WolvHaven's first city building world.</li>
            <li>Built around a government-owned national railway network, players usually claim and build their cities around prebuilt stations.</li>
            <li>The stations are spaced approximately 500m apart, and expansion may be limited due to neighboring claims along the rail line.</li>
            <li class="font-bold">Choose Gardellia if you're starting out small</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Calidia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Opened in 2020, Calidia is WolvHaven's newest city building world.</li>
            <li>Unlike Gardellia, Calidia is a large-biome terrain generated world without any pre-built infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Players usually space out and start their claims where space is available, away from other claims.</li>
            <li>They are expected to collaborate and negotiate should they want to connect their claims using inter-city infrastructure.</li>
            <li class="font-bold">Choose Calidia if you have bigger plans or ambitions</li>
        </ul>
