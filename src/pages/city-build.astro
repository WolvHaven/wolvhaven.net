                        <li>Opened in 2016, Gardellia is WolvHaven's first city building world.</li>
                        <li>Built around a government-owned national railway network, players usually claim and build their cities around prebuilt stations.</li>
                        <li>Stations are spaced approximately 500m apart, and expansion may be limited due to neighboring claims along the rail line.</li>
