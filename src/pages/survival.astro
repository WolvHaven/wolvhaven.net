        <h2>Survival Multiplayer on WolvHaven</h2>
        <p class="p-5 rounded-lg bg-amber-100 border border-amber-200">SMP on WolvHaven is due for a Hard Reset as voted for by the community. It's replacement, "Avalon" will come in 2024. We do not recommend getting too invested in the current SMP world (Pangea)</p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-white bg-main-50 p-1">Avalon</span> is the SMP world in WolvHaven where you can work on your own or with friends to survive and build in the traditional Minecraft fashion. Forge a community with friends and build a quaint village or master your creative skills with a great castle atop a hill!
