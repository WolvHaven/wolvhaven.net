        <h2>The server's capital</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="text-white bg-main-50 p-1">WolvHaven City</span> is the capital of the server. When WolvHaven was established in 2011, its main goal was to create an immersive city in Minecraft for a survival-roleplay experience.
        </p>
        <p>As the server evolved into one that focuses on creative building, WolvHaven City has evolved into acting as the showcase city, and community-build of the server.</p>
        <p>The city is in its 5th edition, dubbed "New Wolfminster", and is over 10x larger than its predecessor, <a href="/wolvhaven(4h)">New WolvHaven (4H)</a>.</p>
