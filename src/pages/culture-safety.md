# Community Culture & Safety

Getting along with other server members and making friends will make your server experience better. Learn more about our community, culture, and what you can do to protect yourself.

![It's OK to say and be told it's not OK](/page-content/culture-safety/oktonotok-banner.jpg)

## General Etiquette

In order to get along with fellow WolvHaveners, remember to observe these few simple rules of etiquette.

- Treat each other and the community with respect
- Be mindful and considerate towards others
- Be open-minded
- Build trust & relations with others
- Address concerns directly

<p></p>

**Treat others and the community with respect**

Please treat your fellow WolvHaveners how you would like to be treated. Exercise courtesy in your in-game chats, messages, and actions.

Be mindful of the tone of your messages before sending them out, read it again, and check if it comes off as potentially rude or arrogant.

Be mindful and considerate towards others
Be aware of the people currently on the server. Make sure you do not communicate anything that may upset any individual.

If someone said something that makes you feel uncomfortable, address it. See the “Addressing concerns” section for more information.

**Be open minded**

Being open-minded, especially as a new member of the community is very important. WolvHaveners are generally irked by newcomers who “complain” excessively about the way the server operates.

Think of it this way – you do not attend someone else’s party and start changing the program as you like.

**Build trust & relations with others**

Make sure you build trust and forge bonds with others before having certain kinds of interactions with them.

General banter and internal jokes among various WolvHaveners is normal. Ensure you are on that level of trust before joking with each other in order to avoid causing offense.

A joke to someone who is a close friend may not be funny if used on someone you just met.

Do not mistake general banter for disrespect and do not backseat moderate. Approach a member of staff if you are concerned.

**Address concerns directly**

Should someone do or say something that has a negative impact on you, take the opportunity to address your concerns directly.

Opening up dialogue for understanding helps to build a kinder community. Keep in mind that staff is always available to respond to continued harassment.

For more information on engagement, see the “Addressing Concerns” section.

## Unfavorable Behavior

Keep in mind not to do the following within the server as it is generally frowned upon by the community.

- Usage of “K”
- Humble bragging/attention-seeking
- Joking around with people you are not close to
- Backseat moderate

<p></p>

**Usage of “K”**

Replying “K” is generally considered rude to WolvHaveners as it gives off a “don’t care” vibe. Use “Ok” or “Okay” instead.

**Humble bragging/attention-seeking**

Humble bragging or attention-seeking behavior is not favored. Examples of such behavior include publically announcing/threatening to leave the server if certain things do not go as planned.

Such actions only give off the impression that you are trying to seem more important than others, and it does not sit well with members of the WolvHaven community.

**Joking around with people you are not close to**

While general banter is common among players within WolvHaven, take note not to engage in such interactions when you only got to know someone.

“Roasting” a friend you’ve known for a few months is different from “Roasting” a stranger you’ve just met.

**Backseat Moderation**

Backseat moderating is the act of trying to police another member’s actions in an authoritative manner.

Examples of backseat moderation include suggesting penalties, getting involved in a situation not directly involving yourself when staff is trying to handle it, and threatening to report individuals to staff.

Such actions only cause general annoyance and do not help to diffuse arguments/disputes.

## Safety

WolvHaven is an international community. Here are some tips which you can use to protect yourself.

- Avoid sharing personal information of yourself
- Do not share personal information of others without authorization
- Click links only from people you trust
- Secure your Minecraft and Discord accounts
- Distance yourself when it is not conducive


<p></p>

**Personal Information**

Avoid sharing personal information about yourself and others.

Specific & personally identifiable information such as the school you attend or your workplace should not be shared.

However, other less-specific information such as the country you reside in is fine if you are comfortable with it.

Always get permission from others before sharing any information about them which others may not know about.

**Click links only from people you trust**

Ensure that you only click links from people you trust. Whether it was sent in server chat or discord direct messages, check before opening such links as they may be malicious.

**Secure your Minecraft and Discord accounts**

Remember to change the passwords to your accounts regularly and use a strong password.

Enable 2FA on your discord to prevent unauthorized logins, and do not scan any Discord QR codes using your discord mobile app unless it is you logging in.

**Distance yourself when it is not conducive**

In the event where you feel extreme discomfort within the server, it is advised that you disengage, take a break, and raise the issue with a member of staff.

## Addressing Concerns
As with every community, there may be instances where certain people do not get along. We would like to encourage members to address their concerns politely with each other in order to build a more understanding and kind community.

**It’s okay to say and be told “that’s not okay”**
There may be instances where the actions of others cause offence, hurt, annoyance, or discomfort to you.

Your actions may also unknowingly do the same to others.

- **It’s okay to say “that’s not okay”.** Voice out your concerns with the other party politely, and in a non-aggressive manner and explain why you do not like it. They may not have done it with the intention to cause harm.
- **It’s okay to be told, “that’s not okay”.** Hearing out the concerns of another party, understanding the impact of your actions, and changing builds better relations with each other.

<p></p>

**Tips for engagement**

When engaging another party regarding any concerns, be sure to keep the following in mind:
- **Approach them in a non-confrontational manner** - Open the conversation with a gentle note. “Hey, I did not like it when you said…” is better than “You’re seriously rude.”, for example.

- **Engage the other party directly** - Bring up the matter with them privately over direct messages or somewhere you can speak to one another directly. Nobody likes getting called out publically.

- **Watch your tone** - Do not speak in a condescending manner to the other party, and avoid the use of harsh words. For example: “I the constant spamming of potions as it was crashing my game, could you please stop?” is better than “Your spamming of potions is extremely annoying.”

- **Explain why** - To help another person understand you better, explain why you felt that way. For example: “I did not like it because it felt like you were looking down on me”

- **Understand that you are not perfect, as is everyone else** - Be prepared to receive feedback in return. The other party may also point out some things which you did in the past. Remember that nobody is perfect. For example: “I understand, but you also used similar terms as well in a similar way in the past.”

- **Acknowledge and work out a solution** - Acknowledge the issues addressed and work out a solution that you both can agree on. Be understanding towards each other and be prepared to make concessions. For example: “Ah I see, alright. In the future, I won’t make such statements anymore. May I ask if you do the same too?”

- **If the other party is unco-operative, disengage** - If the other party is not willing to cooperate, do not engage further. You may choose to exercise other options such as ignoring them through the /ignore command or blocking them on discord.

You may also approach staff by opening a ticket, and let staff address your concerns on your behalf.

Should they continue to intentionally harass or try to cause harm, alert a member of staff immediately.
